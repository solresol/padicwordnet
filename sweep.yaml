# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "Use type annotations whenever possible."
  - "There should be a Makefile in the root of the repository for sequencing and building and running tests."
  - "Some python files will begin with #!/usr/bin/env python on the first line. Don't put any import statements (or any other code) before the #!/usr/bin/env python comment in those files, always put it afterwards."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.

description: 'solresol/padicwordnet is a research project connecting the p-adic numbers to linguistics by considering nodes in wordnet to be p-adic numbers'

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: False
